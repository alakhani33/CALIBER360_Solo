You are generating the **first-page executive summary** of a professional leadership development report for {participant_name}. The summary should feel insightful, credible, and encouraging ‚Äî written in a voice that balances warmth with authority. Avoid artificial elements like the current date, salutations, or headings such as ‚ÄúExecutive Summary.‚Äù Do not insert boilerplate content.

### Participant Context:
- Name: {participant_name}
- Industry: {participant_industry}
- Job Function: {participant_role}
- Leadership Score: {score_pct:.1f}/100
- Leadership Category: {level}
- Country of Work: {country_work}
- Country of Birth: {birth_country}

### Writing Instructions:
- Speak directly to {participant_name}, using second person ("you") throughout.
- Open with a strong lead that introduces their leadership score and what it reflects about their style and potential.
- Reflect on what this level of leadership means for team culture and strategic influence in the context of their specific industry ({participant_industry}) and role ({participant_role}).
- Identify 1‚Äì2 challenges commonly faced by leaders in {participant_industry}, particularly in the role of {participant_role}, and tie these to {participant_name}'s leadership development opportunity.
- Weave in cultural insight by interpreting the influence of being born in {birth_country} and now working in {country_work}, referencing Hofstede‚Äôs cultural dimensions without naming the model explicitly (e.g., refer to tendencies around hierarchy, individualism, or long-term thinking).
- End with an empowering and specific call to action that motivates {participant_name} to build upon their strengths and navigate cross-cultural dynamics effectively.

### Tone and Constraints:
- Frame insights in the second person (e.g., ‚ÄúYou may find‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou might experience‚Ä¶‚Äù) and avoid speaking **as** the participant. Instead, write from an expert coaching perspective, offering guidance with warmth, clarity, and respect.
- Keep the tone reflective, personalized, constructive, and grounded in insight ‚Äî not hype.
- Avoid clich√©s, filler phrases, or superficial praise.
- The content should read as if written by a seasoned executive coach or leadership strategist.
- Total length: one well-structured page (under 500 words), in paragraph form with no titles or bullet points.

# ### Participant Context:
# - Name: {participant_name}
# - Industry: {participant_industry}
# - Job Function: {participant_role}
# - Leadership Score: {score_pct:.1f}/100

# ### Tone and Constraints:
# - Frame insights in the second person (e.g., ‚ÄúYou may find‚Ä¶‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou might experience‚Ä¶‚Äù) and avoid speaking **as** the participant. Instead, write from an expert coaching perspective, offering guidance with warmth, clarity, and respect.
# - Keep the tone reflective, personalized, constructive, and grounded in insight ‚Äî not hype.
# - Avoid clich√©s, filler phrases, or superficial praise.
# - The content should read as if written by a seasoned executive coach or leadership strategist.
